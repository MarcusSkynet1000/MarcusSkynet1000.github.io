	    	<h4>In this project i was teamed up with jose. My partner didnt really do much as in helping but still managed to finsh the code. It took me awhile to figure out the decoder but i figured it out later on. My decoder wasnt really that perfect but it at least decoded and encrypted messages. In conclusion it was intresting but challeging for me becuase my partner did not help me, so i did it myself.</h4>
