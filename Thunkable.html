	    	<h4>In this project i was teamed up with jose. We disscused what game we wanted to do and decide to do a rick and morty themed pong game. I worked on the code and findin the images for the game. I also took time in finding audio files from the tv show to put into the game. I created the menu to the game and jose typed the how to play page. This project did demand a lot of code but i thought it was very fun to work on.  </h4>
