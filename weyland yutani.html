	<h2>Story</h2>
	<p>	In the beginning . . .</p>
	<p>	Uranus wakes up in a bloody pit and stares into the dark void.</p>
 	<p>	 	Uranus: Where am I?</p>
	<p>	Suddenly a hellhound appears slowly from the shadows of the pit.</p>
 	<p>		 Hellhound: You're in hell.</p>
	<p>	Uranus screams and tries to run away from the beast.</p>
  	<p>		 Hellhound: WAIT!!!!!! I have answers to your questions Uranus.</p>
 	<p>		 Uranus: Wait! What? How do you know my name?</p>
 	<p>		 Hellhound: I know everything. I know that you are a wimp who was bullied and I know how you died.</p>
	<p>		 Uranus: How I died. How did I die?</p>
	<p>	 	 Hellhound: Do you really want to know. It is hilariously embarrassing.</p> 
	<p>		 Uranus: *Make decision whether to view death flashback*</p>
	<p>			Death Flashback:</p>
	<p>			You were cornered by your usual bullies, when they noticed you buying some medical marijuana from your dealer. They wanted to take your drugs, but you were uncharacteristically obstinate and refused. One of them starts strangling you so you would release the drugs. You kept on clenching the bag of weed like it is your lifeline. Your vision starts to tunnel and the last thing you hear is “ Wow, Uranus is turning really blue.”</p>
 
 	<p>	 	 Hellhound: So because you were equally good as you were bad, your actions and decisions will determine whether you will stay in Hell, or go to Heaven. Go forth and make your decisions.</p>

	<p>	*The rest of the story is adequately portrayed in the attached Flowchart of the Hell game.*</p>
